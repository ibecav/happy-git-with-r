### Use a GitHub Organization

[GitHub Organizations](https://help.github.com/articles/differences-between-user-and-organization-accounts/) are "shared accounts where groups of people can collaborate across many projects at once". This is the most appropriate structure for stewarding course resources, since I can grant TAs and students different levels of access to various repositories. Access can be controlled at the individual user level or, more conveniently, for entire [Teams](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-teams/). The TA Team shares write access with me on a private repository for internal matters. I provide each student with their own private repository for coursework and grant other members of the Students Team read access, in order to facilitate peer review. There is a public repository that underpins the course website (see below). We have one other public repository that exists solely so the [Issues](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion/issues) can be used as a discussion forum.

GitHub actively encourages the use of its platform in teaching. As an instructor you can request a [free Organization account](https://help.github.com/articles/discounted-organization-accounts/) that provides features normally available only on paid plans, such as private repositories. In fact, GitHub provides tooling for specific teaching workflows via [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), although I do not use it. That is not an intentional knock on their tools. I started teaching with GitHub several years before this existed and developed a different way of using the platform. I also find the [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com) resources to be geared more towards computer science than data science.
