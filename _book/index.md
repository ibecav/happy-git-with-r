# Let's Git started {-}

This book provides opinionated instructions on how to:

  * Install Git and get it working smoothly with GitHub, especially in the 
    [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/).
  * Develop a few key workflows that cover your most common tasks.
  * Integrate Git and GitHub into your daily work with R and 
    [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).
  
The target reader is someone who uses R for data analysis or who works on R
packages, although some of the content may be useful to those working in
adjacent areas. This is a CT DPH specific edition, kindly made possible
by the original authors' Creative Commons License.

The first two parts, [Installation](#install-intro) and 
[Connect Git, GitHub, RStudio](#connect-intro), provide a "batteries included"
quick start to verify your setup.

In [Early GitHub Wins](#usage-intro), we rack up some early success with the
basic workflows that are necessary to get your work onto GitHub. We also show
the special synergy between R/R Markdown/RStudio and GitHub, which provides a
powerful demonstration of why all this setup is worthwhile.

Our use of Git/GitHub for DPH work has a slightly different vibe from that of
pure software development, due to differences in the user's context and
objective. This book aims to complement existing, general Git resources by
highlighting the most rewarding usage patterns for us. This
perspective on the Git landscape is presented in 
[Basic Git Concepts](#git-intro) and [Daily Workflows](#workflows-intro).
