**Registration Advice**

You change a lot of settings in the future, so don't fret about any of that now.
**Except your username. You might want to give that some thought.**

A few tips, which sadly may contradict each other:

  * Use an email address you actually monitor and follow. The 
    most likely address is your ct.gov address unless you're
    already a GitHub user in which case you can stick with that.
  * Incorporate at least part of your actual name! People like to know who
    they're dealing with. Also makes your username easier for people to guess or
    remember.
  * Feel free to reuse your username from other contexts, e.g., Twitter or Slack.
  * Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss.
  * Shorter is better than longer.
  * Avoid words laden with special meaning in programming. In my first inept
    efforts to script around the GitHub API, I assigned lots of issues to 
    [the guy with username `NA`](https://github.com/na) because my vector of GitHub
    usernames contained missing values.
  * Avoid the use of upper vs. lower case to separate words. We highly recommend
    all lowercase. GitHub treats usernames in a case insensitive way, but using
    all lowercase is kinder to people doing downstream regular expression work
    with usernames, in various languages. A better strategy for word separation
    is to use an underscore `_`.

You can change your username later, but better to get this right the first time.
