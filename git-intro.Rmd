# Some Git basics {#git-intro}

We've told you shockingly little about Git so far! This is by design.

We find that actual usage, in the course of your work, is the most effective way
to build up a useful mental model for Git. However, building on this early
success, now is the perfect time to explicitly define some Git vocabulary. We
also want to help you link Git concepts to data science tasks and projects. This
part collects anything we've written about core Git concepts. It is a work in
progress and is conceived as a complement to the many excellent 
[external resources for Git](#resources), which we have no desire to re-invent.


## Repo, commit, diff, tag {#git-basics}

### Repos or repositories

Git is a version control system whose original purpose was to help groups of
developers work collaboratively on big software projects. Git manages the
evolution of a set of files -- called a __repository__ or __repo__ -- in a
highly structured way. Historically, these files would have consisted of source
code and the instructions for how to build an application from its source.

Git has been re-purposed by the data science community 
[@Ram2013; @git-for-humans; @ten-simple-rules-git]. 
We use it to manage the motley collection of files that make up typical data
analytical projects, which consist of data, figures, reports, and, yes, some
source code.

For new or existing projects, we recommend that you:

  * Dedicate a local directory or folder to it.
  * Make it an RStudio Project. *Optional but recommended; obviously only applies to projects involving R and users of RStudio.*
  * Make it a Git repository.
  
This setup happens once per project and can happen at project inception or at
any later point. Chances are your existing projects each already live in a
dedicated directory. Making such a directory an RStudio Project and Git
repository boils down to allowing those applications to leave notes for
themselves in hidden files or directories. The project is still a regular
directory on your computer, that you can locate, name, move, and generally
interact with as you wish. You don't have to handle it with special gloves!

The daily workflow is probably not dramatically different from what you do
currently. You work in the usual way, writing R scripts or authoring reports in
LaTeX or R Markdown. But instead of only *saving* individual files, periodically
you make a __commit__, which takes a snapshot of all the files in the entire
project. If you have ever versioned a file
[by adding your initials or the date](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1531), 
you have effectively made a commit, albeit only for a single file. It is a
version that is significant to you and that you might want to inspect or revert
to later. Periodically, you push commits to GitHub. This is like sharing a
document with colleagues on DropBox or sending it out as an email attachment. By
pushing to GitHub, you make your work and all your accumulated progress
accessible to others.
  
This is a moderate change to your normal, daily workflow. It feels weird at
first, but quickly becomes second nature.

### Commits, diffs, and tags

We now connect the fundamental concepts of Git to the data science workflow:

  * repository
  * commit
  * diff

Recall that a repository or repo is just a directory of files that Git manages
holistically. A commit functions like a snapshot of all the files in the repo,
at a specific moment. Under the hood, that is not exactly how Git implements
things. Although mental models don't have to be accurate in order to be useful,
in this case it helps to align the two.

```{r commit-diff-sha-tag, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap="\\label{fig:commit-diff-sha-tag}Partial commit history for our iris example, highlighting diffs, commit messages, SHAs, and tags."}
knitr::include_graphics("img/commit-diff-sha-tag.png")
```

Figure \@ref(fig:commit-diff-sha-tag) is a look at a fictional analysis of the
iris data, focusing on the evolution of a script, `iris.R`. Consider version A
of this file and a modified version, version B. Assume that version A was part
of one Git commit and version B was part of the next commit. The set of
differences between A and B is called a "diff" and Git users contemplate diffs a
lot. Diff inspection is how you re-explain to yourself how version A differs
from version B. Diff inspection is not limited to adjacent commits. You can
inspect the diffs between any two commits.

In fact, Git's notion of any specific version of `iris.R` is as an accumulation
of diffs. If you go back far enough, you find the commit where the file was
created in the first place. Every later version is stored by Git as that initial
version, plus all the intervening diffs in the history that affect the file.
We'll set these internal details aside now, but understanding the importance of
these deltas will make Git's operations less baffling in the long run.

So, by looking at diffs, it's easy to see how two snapshots differ, but what
about the why?

Every time you make a commit you must also write a short __commit message__.
Ideally, this conveys the motivation for the change. Remember, the diff will
show the content. When you revisit a project after a break or need to digest
recent changes made by a colleague, looking at the __history__, by reading
commit messages and skimming through diffs, is an extremely efficient way to get
up to speed. Figure \@ref(fig:commit-diff-sha-tag) shows the messages associated
with the last three commits.

Every commit needs some sort of nickname, so you can identify it. Git does this
automatically, assigning each commit what is called a SHA, a seemingly random
string of 40 letters and numbers (it is not, in fact, random but is a SHA-1
checksum hash of the commit). Though you will be exposed to these, you don't
have to handle them directly very often and, when you do, usually the first 7
characters suffice. The commit messages in Figure \@ref(fig:commit-diff-sha-tag)
are prefixed by such truncated SHAs. You can also designate certain snapshots as
special with a __tag__, which is a name of your choosing. In a software project,
it is typical to tag a release with its version, e.g., "v1.0.3". For a
manuscript or analytical project, you might tag the version submitted to a
journal or transmitted to external collaborators. Figure
\@ref(fig:commit-diff-sha-tag) shows a tag, "draft-01", associated with the last
commit.

## Git commands {#git-commands}

A collection of some of the Git commands that have been largely going on under
the hood. We've emphasized early workflows that are possible in RStudio. But all
of this and much more can be done from the command line. This list is here
mostly so we can consult it during live workshops if needed.

*Unless you use the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/), 
most of the GitHub bits really have to be done from the browser.*

New local git repo from a repo on GitHub:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/jennybc/happy-git-with-r.git
```

Check the remote was cloned successfully:

``` bash
git remote --verbose
```

Stage local changes, commit:

``` bash
git add foo.txt
git commit --message "A commit message"
```

Check on the state of the Git world:

``` bash
git status
git log
git log --oneline
```

Compare versions:

``` bash
git diff
```

Add a remote to existing local repo:

``` bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/jennybc/happy-git-with-r
git remote --verbose
git remote show origin
```

Push local master to GitHub master and have local master track master on
GitHub:

``` bash
git push --set-upstream origin master
## shorter form
git push -u origin master
## you only need to set upstream tracking once!
```

Regular push:

``` bash
git push 
## the above usually implies (and certainly does in our tutorial)
git push origin master
## git push [remote-name] [branch-name]
```

Pull commits from GitHub:

``` bash
git pull
```

Pull commits and don't let it put you in a merge conflict pickle:

``` bash
git pull --ff-only
```

Fetch commits

``` bash
git fetch
```

Switch to a branch

``` bash
git checkout [branch-name]
```

Checking remote and branch tracking

``` bash
git remote -v
git branch -vv
```

## Branches {#git-branches}

Branching means that you take a detour from the main stream of development and
do work without changing the main stream. It allows one or many people to work
in parallel without overwriting each other's work.

Branching in git is very lightweight, which means creating a branch and
switching between branches is nearly instantaneous. This means git encourages
workflows which create small branches for exploration or new features, often
merging them back together quickly.

### Create a new branch

You can create a new branch with `git branch`, then checkout the branch with
`git checkout`. To distinguish it from the main stream of development,
presumably on `master`, we'll call this a "feature branch".

```shell
git branch issue-5
git checkout issue-5
```

You can also use the shortcut `git checkout -b issue-5` to create and checkout
the branch all at once.

Once you have switched to a branch, you can commit to it as usual.

### Switching branches

You use `git checkout` to switch between branches.

But what do you do if you are working on a branch and need to switch,
but the work on the current branch is not complete? One option is the 
[Git stash](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/ch00/_git_stashing), 
but generally a better option is to safeguard the current state with a temporary
commit. Here I use "WIP" as the commit message to indicate work in progress.

```shell
git commit --all -m "WIP"
git checkout master
```

Then when you come back to the branch and continue your work, you need to undo
the temporary commit by [resetting](#reset) your state. Specifically, we want a
mixed reset. This is "working directory safe", i.e. it does not affect the state
of any files. But it does peel off the temporary WIP commit. Below, the
reference `HEAD^` says to roll the commit state back to the parent of the
current commit (`HEAD`).

```shell
git checkout issue-5
git reset HEAD^
```

If this is difficult to remember, or to roll the commit state back to a
different previous state, the reference can also be given as the SHA of a
specific commit, which you can see via `git log`.

### Merging a branch

Once you have done your work and committed it to the feature branch, you can
switch back to `master` and merge the feature branch.

```shell
git checkout master
git merge issue-5
```

### Dealing with conflicts

Most of the time, the merge will go smoothly. However if both the branches you
are merging changed the same part of the same file you will get a merge
conflict.

```shell
git merge issue-5
# Auto-merging index.html
# CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in index.html
# Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

The first thing to do is **NOT PANIC**. Merge conflicts are not the end of the
world and most are relatively small and straightforward to resolve.

The first step to solving a merge conflict is determining which files are in
conflict, which you can do with `git status`:

```shell
git status
# On branch master
# You have unmerged paths.
#   (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
# 
# Unmerged paths:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)
# 
#     both modified:      index.html
# 
# no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

So this shows only `index.html` is unmerged and needs to be resolved. We can
then open the file to see what lines are in conflict.

```html
<<<<<<< HEAD:index.html
<div id="footer">contact : email.support@github.com</div>
=======
<div id="footer">
 please contact us at support@github.com
</div>
>>>>>>> issue-5:index.html
```

In this conflict, the lines between `<<<<<< HEAD:index.html` and `======` are
the content from the branch you are currently on. The lines between `=======`
and `>>>>>>> issue-5:index.html` are from the feature branch we are merging.

To resolve the conflict, edit this section until it reflects the state you want
in the merged result. Pick one version or the other or create a hybrid. Also
remove the conflict markers `<<<<<<`, `======` and `>>>>>>`.

```html
<div id="footer">
please contact us at email.support@github.com
</div>
```

Now run `git add index.html` and `git commit` to finalize the merge. CONFLICTS
RESOLVED.

#### Bailing out

If, during the merge, you get confused about the state of things or make a
mistake, use `git merge --abort` to abort the merge and go back to the state
prior to running `git merge`. Then you can try to complete the merge again.

## Remotes {#git-remotes}

Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on the Internet
or another network. A single project can have 1, 2 or even hundreds of remotes.
You pull others changes from remotes and push your changes to remotes.

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
has_bash <- Sys.which('bash') != '' && .Platform$OS.type != 'windows'
```

### Listing what remotes exist

`git remote` lists the names of available remotes, but usually it is more useful
to see what URLs each note corresponds to (with `-v`).

```{bash eval = has_bash}
git remote -v
```

### Adding a new remote

`git clone` automatically adds a new remote, so often you do not need to do this
manually initially. However, after the initial clone, it is often useful to add
additional remotes.

Use `git remote add` to add a new remote

```shell
git remote add happygit https://github.com/jennybc/happy-git-with-r.git
```

Note: when you add a remote you give it a nickname (here `happygit`), which you
can use in git commands in place of the entire URL.

```shell
git fetch happygit
```

Sidebar on nicknames: there is a strong convention to use `origin` as the
nickname of your main remote. At this point, it is common for the main remote of
a repo to be hosted on GitHub (or GitLab or Bitbucket). It is tempting to use a
more descriptive nickname (such as `github`), but you might find that following
convention is worth it. It makes your setup easier for others to understand and
for you to transfer information that you read in documentation, on Stack
Overflow, or in blogs.

A common reason to add a second remote is when you have done a "fork and clone"
of a repo and your personal copy is set up as the `origin` remote. Eventually
you will want to pull changes from the original repository. It is common to use
`upstream` as the nickname for this remote.

### Fetching data from remotes

To get new data from a remote use `git fetch <remote_name>`. This retrieves the
data locally, but importantly it does _not_ change the state of your repository
or your files in any way. To incorporate the data into your repository, you need
to merge or rebase your project with the remote project.

```shell
# Fetch the data
git fetch happygit

# Now merge it with our local master
git merge happygit/master master

# git pull is a shortcut which does the above in one command
git pull happygit master
```

For more detail on `git pull` workflows, see \@ref(pull-tricky).

### Pushing to remotes

Use `git push <remote> <branch>` to push your local changes to the `<branch>`
branch on the `<remote>` remote.

```shell
# push my local changes to the origin remote's master branch
git push origin master

# push my local changes to the happygit remote's test branch
git push happygit test
```

### Renaming and changing remotes

`git remote rename` can be used to rename a remote

```shell
git remote rename happygit hg
```

`git remote set-url` can be used to change the URL for a remote. This is
sometimes useful if you initially set up a remote using https, but now want to
use the SSH URL instead (or vise versa).

```shell
git remote set-url happygit git@github.com:jennybc/happy-git-with-r.git
```

One fairly common workflow is you initially cloned a repository on GitHub
locally (without forking it), but now want to create your own fork and push
changes to it. As described earlier, it is common to call the main repository
`upstream` and to call your fork `origin`. So, in this case, you need to first
rename the existing remote (from `origin` to `upstream`). Then add your fork as
a new remote, with the name `origin`.

```shell
git remote rename origin upstream
git remote add origin git@github.com:jimhester/happy-git-with-r.git
```

### Upstream tracking branches

It is possible to set the branch on the remote each of your local remotes
corresponds to. `git clone` sets this up automatically, so for your own master
branch this is not something you will run into. However by default if you create
a new branch and try to push to it you will see something like this.

```shell
git checkout -b mybranch
git push
# fatal: The current branch foo has no upstream branch.
# To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use
#
#     git push --set-upstream origin foo
```

You can do as the error message says and explicitly set the upstream branch with
`--set-upstream`. However I would recommend instead changing the default
behavior of `push` to automatically set the upstream branch to the branch with
the same name on the remote.

You can do this by changing the git `push.default` option to `current`.

```shell
git config --global push.default current
```
