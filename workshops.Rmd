# Plan of attack

**It is vital that you attempt to set up your system in advance. You cannot
begin to understand the system if you don't invest some time.**

Try this. Best case scenario is about 1 - 2 hours. If you hit a wall, we will help:

  * [Register a free GitHub account](#github-acct).
  * [Install or update R and RStudio](#install-r-rstudio).
  * [Install Git](#install-git).
  * [Introduce yourself to Git](#hello-git).
  * [Prove local Git can talk to GitHub](#push-pull-github).
  * [Cache your username and password](#credential-caching) or [set up SSH keys](#ssh-keys) so you don't need to authenticate yourself to GitHub interactively *ad nauseum*.
  * [Create and save a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)](#github-pat).
  * [Prove RStudio can find local Git](#rstudio-git-github) and, therefore, can talk to GitHub.
    - FYI: this is where our hands-on activities usually start. We walk through a similar activity together, with narrative, and build from there.
  * Contemplate if you'd like to [install an optional Git client](#git-client), now or in future.

Troubleshooting:

  * Sometimes RStudio [needs a little help finding Git](#rstudio-see-git).
  * General troubleshooting: [RStudio, Git, GitHub Hell](#troubleshooting).
